## Web-Based Instant Chat Messenger

This project is an instant messenger I created during the beginning of summer 2022. This app can be used by anyone to send messages to anyone around the world instantly. In order to begin chatting you just need to input and username and room number. At that point anyone else in that room can see your messages and you can see yours. 

The front end is hosted on netlify and the backend on heroku. I used React to build the page, express servers for the backend and socket.io to communicate between the two.

#### NPM Packages Used For Client
- react@18.1.0
- socket.io-client@4.5.0

#### NPM Packages For Server
- cors@2.8.5
- express@4.18.1
- socket.io@4.5.1
